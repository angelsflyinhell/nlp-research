# nlp-research
 Research files for learning & creating natural language processing models.

## How it's done
 To easily recreate environments and training sessions, I'll be using Jupyter Notebooks with Python.
 Based on the amazing [NLP Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S) Course by [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), I'll mostly use Tensorflow with [Keras](https://keras.io/) for the models.

## The goal
 As I'll be chasing a variety of goals over this learning session / research, I'll include a rough roadmap of what I'm trying to achieve.

### NLP-TWITTER
 A text generation model that can generate tweets, which is also trained on tweets.
